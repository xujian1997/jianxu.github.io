abstract: The Changning shale gas field in the southern Sichuan basin is a prominent unconventional gas development prospect in China, with annual gas production reaching 6.5 billion mÂ³ in 2023. However, the systematic hydraulic fracturing (HF) operations since 2014 have led to a surge in the seismicity rate, including 2 damaging events with magnitude MS > 5 and more than 60 moderate earthquakes with ML>3 (Lei et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023). Prior to 2019, the sparse coverage of regional seismic networks and the resulting limited earthquake location accuracy hindered the detailed characterization of seismogenic faults and seismicity patterns of HF-induced earthquakes. To address this issue, a two-phased dense array consisting of 335 5-Hz nodal stations was deployed in the Changning area between Feb. 28, 2019 and May 8, 2019 with average spacing of 1.5 km. Using the dense array, we detected approximate 14,000 events in total using a neural network-based picker (Zhu et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2023). The detected earthquakes were located by NonLinLoc (Lomax et al., 2000) and could be divided to more than ten clusters in space with magnitudes ranging from to . Further waveform-based relocation and clustering analyses were applied to characterize the complex intersecting sub-faults and fractures in each cloud, and two seismicity patterns with distinct earthquake behaviors were identified. For the deep clouds within the Cambrian layers, which are kilometers below the target shale layer, the linearly distributed earthquakes exhibited apparent unilateral migration patterns with larger magnitudes, lower b-values, higher waveform frequencies, shorter durations, and clear P-wave onsets. In comparison, for those shallow clusters within or near the production shale layer, no obvious migration patterns were observed and the planarly distributed earthquakes exhibit lower magnitudes, higher b-values, lower waveform frequencies, longer durations and obscure P-wave onsets. Combining the seismicity patterns, waveform features as well as numerical simulations of fluid migration and poroelastic stress perturbations, we suggest that deep earthquakes were dominantly triggered by fluid pressure diffusion, while the shallow earthquakes were triggered by both poroelastic stress perturbations and fluid pore pressures.
