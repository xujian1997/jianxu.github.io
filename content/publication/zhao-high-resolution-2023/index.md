abstract: 'On September 5, 2022, a strong MS6.8 earthquake struck the Luding area
  in the Kangding-Moxi segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone, which is the northern
  boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan rhombic block, causing considerable casualties. The
  Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone, which is located only tens
  of kilometers away from the Luding earthquake, has hosted frequent moderate to strong
  earthquakes in history and is a dangerous earthquake-prone zone. Therefore, it is
  critical to investigate the regional seismogenic environment for strong earthquakes
  and to evaluate the impact of the Luding earthquake in this area. For this purpose,
  we deployed a dense seismic array comprising over 200 short-period nodes in this
  region from July to August, 2022 and acquired seismic ambient noise for over 30
  days. Using the collected data, we conducted surface wave tomography and obtained
  a high-resolution 3-D shear wave velocity model for the regional shallow crust down
  to 8 km in depth. The key findings include: (1) the Bamei-Kangding segment of the
  Xianshuihe fault zone exhibits widespread stripped lowvelocity anomalies, suggesting
  shear movements at a relatively high temperature of the Xianshuihe fault zone; the
  Zheduoshan granitic pluton situated between the Zheduotang and southern Selaha faults
  shows a distinct low-velocity anomaly, which may be attributed to the localized
  high-temperature anomaly resulted by a deep magmatic heat source and the recent
  rapid uplift of the Zheduoshan area; (2) a ten-kilometer-wide high velocity body
  found below 4 km in depth near the Zhonggu area in the Bamei segment coincides with
  the seismic gap of moderate to strong earthquakes in this region, suggesting that
  the high velocity body may act as a seismic barrier; (3) the heterogeneity of the
  velocity structure along the Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone
  corresponds to the regional changes in temperature, which reveals the reason for
  the spatially varying seismogenic potential in this segment; especially, the Selaha
  and Zheduotang faults which are located along the boundaries between the high and
  low velocity anomalies may possess considerable seismogenic potential; (4) the Coulomb
  failure stress calculations indicate that the Luding earthquake has imposed nontrivial
  stress loading in the Bamei-Kangding segment, and may shorten the earthquake recurrence
  intervals of the southern Selaha fault, the Zheduotang fault, and the Xuemenkan
  segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone. Thus, the Luding earthquake may potentially
  pose threats to the Sichuan-Xizang railway passing through this region.'
