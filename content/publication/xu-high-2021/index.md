abstract: As the largest fault trending NNE-SSW to NE-SW in the eastern Eurasia Continent,
  the Tanlu fault zone (TLFZ) extends over 2,400 km within China, roughly from Wuxue,
  Hubei Province, to Russia. Since the Quaternary period, the TLFZ has been an earthquake-prone
  area in eastern China where several major earthquakes resulted by tectonic compression
  occurred, causing tremendous casualties and significant economic losses. Many studies
  on different segments of the TLFZ have been carried out in the past few decades.
  However, numerous key questions regarding the fault zone remain unanswered due to
  a lack of clear subsurface characterization and fault delineation. In this study,
  we present high-resolution tomographic results across the TLFZ to the east of Hefei,
  where one 22-km-long passive seismic array with densely spaced short-period nodes,
  and a 24-km-long magnetotelluric array were deployed adjacent to each other. We
  find the velocity and resistivity variations are highly consistent with known surface
  geology. Sharp property contrasts in both the seismic shear wave velocity and electrical
  resistivity profiles clearly delineate the Tanlu F1 fault (TLF-1) near Hefei. More
  interestingly, an upwelling with distinct high velocity is imaged within the Hefei
  Basin to the west of the TLF-1, whereas a slanted block with low-velocity and low-resistivity
  seems to cut into or thrust upon the high-grade to low-grade middle-pressure rocks
  in the Zhangbaling uplift right below the Tanlu F2 ductile shear fault (TLF-2).
  The presented results show a new approach to characterize deep subsurface structure
  of the TLFZ beyond 2-km depths using passive data, which it is often difficult for
  active seismic surveys with refracted and reflected waves to image.
