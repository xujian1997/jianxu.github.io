abstract: The changning shale gas field (CSF) is suitated in the southern Sichuan Basin, China and ranks as one of the largest unconventional shale gas reservoirs in China. Over 550 horizontal wells targeting the Wufeng-Longmaxi (W-L) marine shale formation have been completed since commercial production commenced in 2013, yielding an annual production of ~ 6.5 billion m^3 in 2022. The CSF has undergone multistage geological folding since the Indosinian period that resulted in a predominantly synclinal structure. 3D seismic reflection imaging shows evidence for predominantly NEE-NE or NW trending fault systems. Large horizontal differential stresses (>10 MPa) make the Changning shale gas field susceptible to induced earthquakes, similar to its counterparts in North America. Since systematic seismic monitoring started in 2015, the number of moderate to strong earthquakes in the CSF has increased dramatically, including 2 damaging M>5 events, 21 M≥4, and more than 90 M≥3 earthquakes. In May 2023, a sequence of four M4+ earthquakes struck the east of CSF within 3 days, further raising concerns about induced seismic hazard in this region.
