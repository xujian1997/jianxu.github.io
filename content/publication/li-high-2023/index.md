abstract: Abstract  Moderate to strong earthquakes have been induced worldwide by
  shale gas development, however, it is still unclear what factors control their behaviors.
  Here we use local seismic networks to reliably determine the source attributes of
  dozens of M‚Äâtextgreater‚Äâ3 earthquakes and obtain a high-resolution shear-wave velocity
  model using ambient noise tomography. These earthquakes are found to occur close
  to the target shale formations in depth and along high seismic velocity boundaries.
  The magnitudes and co-seismic slip distributions of the 2018 Xingwen   $$M_rmL5.7$$    M   L   5.7    and
  2019 Gongxian   $$M_rmL5.3$$    M   L   5.3    earthquakes are further determined
  jointly by seismic waveforms and InSAR data, and the co-seismic slips of these two
  earthquakes correlate with high seismic velocity zones along the fault planes. Thus,
  the distribution of high velocity zones near the target shale formations, together
  with the stress state modulated by hydraulic fracturing controls induced earthquake
  behaviors and is critical for understanding the seismic potentials of hydraulic
  fracturing.
