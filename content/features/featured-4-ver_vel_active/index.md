abstract: Source attribute analysis for the Xingwen M5.7 earthquake. a The Xingwen (XW) M5.7 earthquake sequence monitored by the local network within 40 days from 26 Nov., 2018 to 6 Jan., 2019. The top left elliptical inset shows the zoomed-in spatial pattern of the fore-main-aftershocks, and the black and magenta dots represent foreshocks and aftershocks, respectively. The gray dots denote more distant induced seismicity. The blue squares mark the hydraulic fracturing well pads close to line BB’ with the N201H24 well pad highlighted by red. The magenta beachballs represent the moderate earthquakes close to the line BB’. b The velocity anomaly profile along the rupture plane shown as line A-A’ in (a). The initiation point is indicated by the black star, and the main slip areas are enclosed by the white dashed lines. The black and magenta dots indicate the foreshocks and aftershocks within 1 km in distance to the rupture plane AA’. The origin of the cross-section is referenced to the initiation point and the anomaly is referenced to the average velocity at each depth. The locations of the HF platforms close to line AA’ are plotted on top. c The distribution of the co-seismic slips from the finite-fault rupture inversion (see Methods) along the same fault plane in (b). d Comparison between the 2-D active source seismic profile (39) with the shear velocity model from ANT. The major stratigraphic layers are marked. The depths of the lithological sequence are determined by well N20337. The locations of the HF platforms close to line BB’ are plotted at the top of panel (d).


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The magnitudes and co-seismic slip distributions of the 2018 Xingwen M5.7 and 2019 Gongxian M5.3 earthquakes are further determined jointly by seismic waveforms and InSAR data, and the co-seismic slips of these two earthquakes correlate with high seismic velocity zones along the fault planes.
