abstract:  Velocity slices shown at four depths 1.5 km, 2 km, 2.5 km and 3 km (mean sea level, MSL). The source mechanisms for those events occurring between 2015 and 2019 with ML>3:0 (blue beachballs with magenta epicenters), and of those between 2019 and 2022 with M>4.0 (black) are shown accompanied by the compressional and tensional axes. The determined depths of the source mechanisms projected to the individual velocity slices are 0–1.75, 1.75–2.25, 2.25–2.75, 2.75–4 km, respectively. In panel (a) the black dots represent the microearthquakes recorded by the two-phased dense arrays from 28 Feb., 2019 to 6 May, 2019. In panel (b), the black curve outlines the Jianwu syncline adapted from Lu et at. (2021), and the red lines indicate the known faults identified from surface traces. In panel (c), the purple boxes indicate the Changning-Zhaotong shale gas field.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The earthquakes locations correlate well with the velocity boundaries with high velocity gradients.
