abstract: Changning shale gas field and induced seismicity monitored by the dense array. (a) 3D perspective of the CSF. The undulating blue surface represents the bottom of the Wufeng-Longmaxi shale formation (production layer) derived from 3D seismic reflection (Lu et al., 2021). Blue lines within the production layer show trajectories of horizontal wells. The gray box in the bottom of (a) indicates the basement, located ~4 km below the mean sea level. Colored dots represent the selected six earthquake clusters, i.e., D1-D3 (orange dots) and S1-S3 (blue dots). (b) Active-source seismic profile along the vertical translucent plane in (b). Solid red lines represent faults detected by active seismic imaging. The deep cluster D2 is not projected onto this profile due to large distance. “F0” labels the nearest basement-rooted fault at the southern edge of the deep cluster D1. (c) Interpretation of formations below the W-L production formation. W-L, Wufeng-Longmaxi shale formation; XXC, Xixiangchi dolomite formation; GT, Gaotai gypsum formation; LWM, Longwangmiao limestone formation; CLP, Canglangpu siltstone formation; QZS Qiongzhusi shale formation and the Precambrian basement.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A comparison of the hypocenter distributions with an active seismic reflection profile transecting the clusters in proximity reveals a clear alignment between the focal depths of the events and the undulations of the layers.
