abstract:  Location of Changning shale gas field. (a) Changning Shale gas Field (CSF) in the southern Sichuan Basin (SCB), China. (b) Hydraulic fracturing (HF) well pads (yellow squares), horizontal well trajectories (black solid lines) and identified fault traces (magenta lines) from Ma et al. (2020). The dashed boxes indicate the coverage of a two-phased nodal array with station locations shown in (c). The cyan triangles represent 10 short-period seismic stations in Tan et al. (2023). The orange dots show the seismicity detected by the dense array between February 28, 2019 and May 8, 2019. Two red stars mark the 2018 M5.7 Xingwen earthquake, 2019 M5.3 Gongxian earthquake, and the 2023 four M4+ earthquakes, respectively. The arrows indicate the maximum horizontal stress oriented at N107°(Li et al., 2023). Top right rose diagram shows fault orientation distribution. (c) Detailed station distributions of the two-phased nodal array.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The CSF is suitated in the southern Sichuan Basin and ranks as one of the largest unconventional shale gas reservoirs in China (Fig. 1a) (Zou et al., 2022). Over 550 horizontal wells targeting the Wufeng-Longmaxi (W-L) marine shale formation have been completed since commercial production commenced in 2013 (Figs. 1, 2), yielding an annual production of ~ 6.5 billion m^3 in 2022. Since systematic seismic monitoring started in 2015, the number of moderate to strong earthquakes in the CSF has increased dramatically, including 2 damaging M>5 events, 21 M≥4, and more than 90 M≥3 earthquakes (Li et al., 2023). In May 2023, a sequence of four M4+ earthquakes struck the east of CSF within 3 days, further raising concerns about induced seismic hazard in this region
