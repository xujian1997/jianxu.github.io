	abstract = {On September 5, 2022, a strong MS6.8 earthquake struck the Luding area in the Kangding-Moxi segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone, which is the northern boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan rhombic block, causing considerable casualties. The Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone, which is located only tens of kilometers away from the Luding earthquake, has hosted frequent moderate to strong earthquakes in history and is a dangerous earthquake-prone zone. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the regional seismogenic environment for strong earthquakes and to evaluate the impact of the Luding earthquake in this area. For this purpose, we deployed a dense seismic array comprising over 200 short-period nodes in this region from July to August, 2022 and acquired seismic ambient noise for over 30 days. Using the collected data, we conducted surface wave tomography and obtained a high-resolution 3-D shear wave velocity model for the regional shallow crust down to 8 km in depth. The key findings include: (1) the Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone exhibits widespread stripped lowvelocity anomalies, suggesting shear movements at a relatively high temperature of the Xianshuihe fault zone; the Zheduoshan granitic pluton situated between the Zheduotang and southern Selaha faults shows a distinct low-velocity anomaly, which may be attributed to the localized high-temperature anomaly resulted by a deep magmatic heat source and the recent rapid uplift of the Zheduoshan area; (2) a ten-kilometer-wide high velocity body found below 4 km in depth near the Zhonggu area in the Bamei segment coincides with the seismic gap of moderate to strong earthquakes in this region, suggesting that the high velocity body may act as a seismic barrier; (3) the heterogeneity of the velocity structure along the Bamei-Kangding segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone corresponds to the regional changes in temperature, which reveals the reason for the spatially varying seismogenic potential in this segment; especially, the Selaha and Zheduotang faults which are located along the boundaries between the high and low velocity anomalies may possess considerable seismogenic potential; (4) the Coulomb failure stress calculations indicate that the Luding earthquake has imposed nontrivial stress loading in the Bamei-Kangding segment, and may shorten the earthquake recurrence intervals of the southern Selaha fault, the Zheduotang fault, and the Xuemenkan segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone. Thus, the Luding earthquake may potentially pose threats to the Sichuan-Xizang railway passing through this region.},

	abstract = {As the largest fault trending NNE-SSW to NE-SW in the eastern Eurasia Continent, the Tanlu fault zone (TLFZ) extends over 2,400 km within China, roughly from Wuxue, Hubei Province, to Russia. Since the Quaternary period, the TLFZ has been an earthquake-prone area in eastern China where several major earthquakes resulted by tectonic compression occurred, causing tremendous casualties and significant economic losses. Many studies on different segments of the TLFZ have been carried out in the past few decades. However, numerous key questions regarding the fault zone remain unanswered due to a lack of clear subsurface characterization and fault delineation. In this study, we present high-resolution tomographic results across the TLFZ to the east of Hefei, where one 22-km-long passive seismic array with densely spaced short-period nodes, and a 24-km-long magnetotelluric array were deployed adjacent to each other. We find the velocity and resistivity variations are highly consistent with known surface geology. Sharp property contrasts in both the seismic shear wave velocity and electrical resistivity profiles clearly delineate the Tanlu F1 fault (TLF-1) near Hefei. More interestingly, an upwelling with distinct high velocity is imaged within the Hefei Basin to the west of the TLF-1, whereas a slanted block with low-velocity and low-resistivity seems to cut into or thrust upon the high-grade to low-grade middle-pressure rocks in the Zhangbaling uplift right below the Tanlu F2 ductile shear fault (TLF-2). The presented results show a new approach to characterize deep subsurface structure of the TLFZ beyond 2-km depths using passive data, which it is often difficult for active seismic surveys with refracted and reflected waves to image.},

              Moderate to strong earthquakes have been induced worldwide by shale gas development, however, it is still unclear what factors control their behaviors. Here we use local seismic networks to reliably determine the source attributes of dozens of M‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚Äâ3 earthquakes and obtain a high-resolution shear-wave velocity model using ambient noise tomography. These earthquakes are found to occur close to the target shale formations in depth and along high seismic velocity boundaries.

              earthquakes are further determined jointly by seismic waveforms and InSAR data, and the co-seismic slips of these two earthquakes correlate with high seismic velocity zones along the fault planes. Thus, the distribution of high velocity zones near the target shale formations, together with the stress state modulated by hydraulic fracturing controls induced earthquake behaviors and is critical for understanding the seismic potentials of hydraulic fracturing.},
